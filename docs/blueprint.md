## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A warm saffron (#FFB833) to evoke a sense of appetite and hospitality. This vibrant color also aligns with cultural associations of food and spices.
- Background color: Very light beige (#F5F5DC) providing a soft, inviting backdrop that doesn't distract from the content. It evokes the traditional aspect of dining, offering a clean and calming feel.
- Accent color: A terracotta color (#E2725B) for calls to action, adding a touch of richness and sophistication, and evoking images of savory traditional dishes. Its muted saturation ensures it complements rather than overpowers the primary saffron.
- Headline font: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for a stylish and elegant appearance, appropriate for headlines.
- Body font: 'Alegreya' (serif) will be used for body text to give comfortable readability. Use this for all text other than titles and headings.
- Custom Icons: Develop custom icons that are intuitive and culturally relevant, fitting within the Middle Eastern context. These icons should reflect various actions and categories within the app (e.g., ordering, menu options).
- Right-to-Left (RTL) Support: Ensure a seamless user experience in Arabic with full RTL layout support across all interfaces. Mirror layouts appropriately and ensure text alignment is correct for Arabic script.
